## Installation

Most of the requirements of this projects are exactly the same as [Scene-Graph-Benchmark](https://github.com/KaihuaTang/Scene-Graph-Benchmark.pytorch) and [maskrcnn-benchmark](https://github.com/facebookresearch/maskrcnn-benchmark). If you have any problem of your environment, you should check their [issues page](https://github.com/facebookresearch/maskrcnn-benchmark/issues) first. Hope you will find the answer.

### Requirements:
- PyTorch >= 1.2 (Mine 1.6.0 (CUDA 10.1))
- torchvision >= 0.4 (Mine 0.7.0 (CUDA 10.1))
- cocoapi
- yacs
- matplotlib
- GCC >= 4.9
- OpenCV


### Step-by-step installation

```bash
# first, make sure that your conda is setup properly with the right environment
# for that, check that `which conda`, `which pip` and `which python` points to the
# right path. From a clean conda env, this is what you need to do

onda create --name SHA_GCL python=3.6
source activate SHA_GCL

# this installs the right pip and dependencies for the fresh python
pip install ipython
pip install scipy
pip install h5py

# scene_graph_benchmark and coco api dependencies
pip install ninja yacs cython matplotlib tqdm opencv-python overrides

# follow PyTorch installation in https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/
# we give the instructions for CUDA 10.1
pip install torch==1.6.0+cu101 torchvision==0.7.0+cu101 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html

# the files if you want and won't need to
# re-build it
python setup.py build develop
